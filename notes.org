** Asynchronous commands
   - Solved the problem of asynchronous commands by creating a mutex that is set in the handler function whenever there is an asynchronous command.
   - Currently there is only one mutex in the server, and when the handler is in a asynchronous command it should be set busy, and refuse to do another asynchronous command.
   - [X] Add AsyncBusy status to handler and refuse to run the command if busy.
   - [X] Check server location and refuse to run from remote server.
